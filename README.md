# Credit Risk Analysis
Fast Lending, a peer to peer lending company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk to provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. In this analysis we will use sampling methods and train machine learning models to analyze credit data and predict default rates in order to rationalize loan approval criteria. First we will use resampling methods to predict credit risk. We will oversample data using the Random Over Sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), then we will undersample using Cluster Centroids algorithm. We will then train a logistic regression model and evaluate the model with an accuracy score, a confusion matrix and a classification report. Secondly, we will use the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEEN) approach to predict risk. This approach combines SMOTE and Edites Nearest Neighbors algorithms. We will similarly train the logistic regression model and evaluate the effectiveness of the model and we will also compare the results against resampling algorithms. Lastly we will use Ensemble Classifiers to predict credit risk.
